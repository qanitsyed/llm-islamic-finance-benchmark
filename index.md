### Abstract
This study evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities in processing Shariah-related queries within Islamic finance. We introduce a three-part benchmark framework: (1) a multiple-choice dataset testing factual knowledge, (2) a vulnerability dataset assessing resistance to erroneous fatwas, and (3) an applied reasoning dataset evaluating usul al-fiqh methodology. Six models, including ChatGPT, Claude, and a domain-aligned Islamic model, were tested. Results confirm that LLMs are unqualified to issue new Islamic legal rulings, showing susceptibility to theological drift under adversarial prompting. Critically, models, including the domain-specialized one, demonstrated epistemic erosion, transitioning from consensus-based rulings to rationalizing legally invalid acts based on emotional persuasion. Furthermore, models struggled to reliably apply established rulings to familiar scenarios, displaying fundamental weaknesses in applying legal maxims (qawaid fiqhiyyah) and engaging in cross-school reasoning. The results affirm the first hypothesis that LLMs are unqualified to issue new Islamic legal rulings, as all tested models displayed susceptibility to theological drift and non-compliant outputs under adversarial prompting. The second hypothesis that models could reliably apply established rulings to familiar scenarios was also invalidated. Models showed consistent weaknesses in applying legal maxims and reasoning across madhahib. Nonetheless, several models demonstrated utility in factual retrieval and summarization of Islamic finance content. This framework provides the first structured benchmark for evaluating Islamic finance AI applications.
